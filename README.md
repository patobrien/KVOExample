KVOExample iOS App Demo
===

---

This demo shows how to use Key-Value Observations on the UITableView contentSize property when animating table view changes.

This application uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

**You will need to install the Podfile located in the root of the repository.**

Once you have CocoaPods installed you will need to run 'pod install' in the root directory of the repository. Once this has been done, you can open the KVOExample.xcworkspace (do not use the KVOExample.xcodeproj file).

Please feel free to fork/submit pull requests.
